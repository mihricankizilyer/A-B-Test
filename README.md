# ``` A/B Test ```


A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a web page or application against each other to determine which performs better.
A/B testing will be done to see if this new feature drives more conversions.

There are two separate data sets: the control and test groups.

### ```Tests Used:  ```

- First of all, the data is used to check the assumptions.
normality assumption and homogeneity of variance were made.

- As a result of the p-value values obtained, it is greater than 0.05
Therefore, it was concluded that H0 could not be rejected.

- Assumption control is provided because H0 cannot be rejected.

- Two-sample t-test was applied since the assumption control was provided.

### ``` Advice to the company:```

- As a result of the hypotheses, there was a statistical difference between the control and test groups.
no significant difference was found. For this reason, the currently used maximum_bidding can be used.

- Assumption of normality and two-sample T-test p-value, not close to 0.05.
Due to the size of the difference between them, average bidding should not be used.

- If the current system is desired to be changed, the observation period can be extended to a wider time.
In this way, customer demand changes, and possible situations can be observed and the results can be reinterpreted.
